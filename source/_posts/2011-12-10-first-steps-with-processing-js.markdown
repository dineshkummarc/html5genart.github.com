I started hacking with Processing.js using the **not** recommended way, which is to use the Javascript method and skip the creation of a PDE file, as described in the [Writing Processing code with JavaScript](http://processingjs.org/learning/)

Moreover, I decided to make certain adjustments to make the Javascript code as readable as the Java-based Processing code (PDE file). In this exploration I came up with a hackish way to do a local import using `eval()` (which shouldn't be used in general).

Therefore, I came up with the following Javascript variations of [learning processing.js] (http://processingjs.org/learning/): [Clock](/html5/generative-art/learning-clock/clock.html) and [Texture Cube](/html5/generative-art/learning-cube/texture_cube.html)

Cheers!

This is a modification of the first example in chapter four of [**Processing for Visual Artists**](http://www.glassner.com/andrew/writing/books/processing.htm) by [Andrew Glassner](http://www.glassner.com/) which consists of an algorithm to simulate the texture of a fabric. I used a vivid pink color and changed the algorithm to be able to visualize the thread creation process one thread at a time.
